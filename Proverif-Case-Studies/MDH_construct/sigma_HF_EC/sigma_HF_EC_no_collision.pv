(* Sigma' case study with the MDH construct using Jaffar's Algorithm.
   This file considers unbounded concatenation of blocks under the hash.
   Does not allow Chosen-Prefix Collisions (Algebraic Associativity only).
*)

(* CHANGE: Use equal_hash (or your updated Jaffar predicate) 
   to trigger the Directed Splitting axioms. *)
expand macro_SIGMA(equal_hash, System).
